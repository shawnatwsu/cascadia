> Most hazard systems answer *"what is the flood risk?"* — one hazard at a time,
> in isolation. **Cascadia** answers a harder, more useful question:
> **"given conditions right now, which hazards are likely, where, who is exposed,
> and how might one hazard trigger another?"**
>
> It fuses **100% free, open data** into a probabilistic **cascade graph** across
> **six hazards**, scales from a single address to the whole United States, and —
> importantly — reports its **measured forecast skill** honestly.

The name is a double meaning: the **Cascadia** bioregion (Pacific Northwest)
*and* the **cascading**-hazard idea at the core of the model.

> ⚠️ **Research prototype — not for operational or life-safety decisions.** Always
> defer to official sources (NWS, USGS, FEMA, local emergency management).

## What it does

- **6 hazards** on one frame: **flood · earthquake · wildfire · landslide · heat · wildfire-smoke**
- **Cascade graph** — hazards can trigger one another (quake→landslide→flood, fire→smoke, heat→fire), with **condition-gated** edges (a quake is far likelier to start a landslide on a *rain-saturated* slope).
- **Any scale** — a single **address**, an **NCA5 region** (Northwest, Southeast, …), or the **whole CONUS** at 4 km.
- **Expected impact** — not just probability, but **expected people affected** (hazard × population).
- **Forecasting** — a 7‑day live forecast, a **weeks 2–6** sub‑seasonal outlook, and an **ENSO‑driven seasonal** outlook with a real ENSO‑forecast ML model.
- **Honest skill** — built‑in validation: reliability diagrams, Brier/ROC, and ENSO teleconnection skill vs. observations.

## Gallery

**National multi‑hazard nowcast** (`run.ps1 conditions conus`) — six hazards on one frame, 4 km, Albers equal‑area, each panel with its own scale:

![CONUS multi-hazard conditions](docs/conus_conditions.png)

**Expected human impact** (`run.ps1 impact conus`) — hazard probability × Census population = expected people affected:

![CONUS impact](docs/impact_conus.png)

**Address‑level report** (`run.ps1 parcel "..."`) — a locator map + per‑hazard levels for any US address. Flood & earthquake are **calibrated probabilities**; the `*` hazards are **relative 0–1 indices** (area‑scale danger, not address‑specific odds). Landslide is refined by the address's **local DEM slope** (flat lot → stable), and the weather‑driven hazards carry **error bars** = 10–90% across **31 GFS ensemble members** (real forecast uncertainty):

![Parcel report](docs/parcel_report.png)

**Honest skill — flood model is calibrated** (`run.ps1 skill`) — the reliability curve sits on the diagonal (a "0.6" verifies ~0.6); ROC‑AUC 0.95, Brier skill +0.51:

![Flood calibration](docs/flood_calibration.png)

**Honest skill — ENSO is a *weak* US seasonal predictor** — moderate correlations (top), but near‑zero out‑of‑sample tercile skill (bottom). We show this rather than overstate it:

![ENSO teleconnection skill](docs/enso_skill.png)

**Would it have flagged real events?** (`run.ps1 hindcast`) — run the engine *historically* at addresses that actually experienced a hazard, vs a calm control date. It gave a **72% flood probability** at a Chehalis WA address the week of the 2007 flood (≈0 in calm August), flagged the Camp Fire and Almeda Fire areas, and stayed near zero at a safe inland address — warns when it should, quiet when it shouldn't:

![Parcel hindcast](docs/parcel_hindcast.png)

**A defensible performance number — on 100 *independent* flood events** (`run.ps1 performance`) — beyond anecdotes, we score the operational flood model on **100 real NWS Storm Events floods (2018–2021) + 100 matched non-events** (same locations, shifted calm dates). Labels come from the NWS event database — *independent* of the gage‑exceedance labels the model was trained on. Result: **ROC‑AUC 0.715, 95% bootstrap CI [0.64, 0.78]** (excludes 0.5 — real, significant discrimination), flagging **56% of real floods at a 22% false‑alarm rate**. Riverine floods (the model's design target) score higher (AUC 0.74) than flash floods (0.70), as expected for a daily‑resolution model:

![Flood performance on independent events](docs/flood_performance.png)

**How far ahead is the warning?** (`run.ps1 leadtime`) — scoring the same events as if the forecast were issued *N days early* shows the flood signal stays detectable (**AUC ≈ 0.65–0.67**) out to the model's **7‑day horizon**, then decays toward chance at 10–14 days as the event moves beyond the forecast window and only antecedent soil/streamflow remain. Exactly the shape a 7‑day model should have:

![Flood lead-time skill](docs/flood_leadtime.png)

**Wildfire holds up too — on independent satellite fires** (`run.ps1 fireperf`) — the wildfire leaf (GRIDMET NFDRS Burning Index + Energy Release Component + 100‑hr fuel moisture) is scored against **80 real NASA FIRMS fire location‑days + 80 matched non‑events**. FIRMS (satellite thermal) is *independent* of GRIDMET (reanalysis weather), so this is a genuine verification: **ROC‑AUC 0.938, 95% CI [0.90, 0.97]**, flagging **92% of real wildfires at a 15% false‑alarm rate**. (Fire danger is *diagnostic* of fire‑prone conditions, not a multi‑day‑ahead forecast — and it's seasonal, so this is the discrimination, not a free lunch.)

![Wildfire performance on independent FIRMS fires](docs/fire_performance.png)

**The cascade *adds skill* — significantly** (`run.ps1 skill`) — validated against EPA‑measured PM2.5 across **4 smoke episodes** (2018–2023, West + cross‑border Canadian smoke; n = 1,131 monitor‑days). Modeling the fire→smoke **downwind transport** (the cascade) ~doubles the correlation vs fire **proximity** (treating smoke as independent): Δr = +0.063, **95% bootstrap CI [+0.008, +0.117]** (excludes zero). Direct evidence for the project's central claim:

## Quick start

**Requirements:** Python 3.10+ on Windows/macOS/Linux.

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/shawnatwsu/cascadia
cd cascadia
```

**Windows (easiest):** double‑click **`run.bat`**, or in a terminal:
```powershell
.\run.ps1                 # first run sets up the venv + installs deps, then runs
```

**Any OS (manual):**
```bash
python -m venv .venv
.venv/Scripts/activate         # Windows  (use: source .venv/bin/activate on mac/linux)
pip install -r requirements.txt
python run.py                  # = the live forecast map
```

**Optional — wildfire smoke & live fire detections** need a free NASA FIRMS key
(1‑minute signup at <https://firms.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/api/map_key/>):
```powershell
setx FIRMS_MAP_KEY "your_key_here"     # then reopen the terminal
```
Without it, smoke/observed‑fire simply read 0; everything else works.

> is printed each time.

## How it works

```
open feeds ─▶ spatial grid ─▶ cross-sector ─▶ per-hazard ─▶ CASCADE GRAPH ─▶ compound
(no API key)   (CONUS-clipped)  indicators      predictors    (noisy-OR over     + impact
                                 (fusion)        (ML + physics) gated triggers)   surface
```

1. **Ingest** open feeds onto a common grid (ocean/Mexico/Canada clipped out).
2. **Per‑hazard predictors** — a mix of trained ML and physically‑grounded models:
   - **flood** → trained gradient‑boosting model (isotonic‑calibrated)
   - **earthquake** → USGS smoothed‑seismicity Poisson prior + aftershocks
   - **wildfire** → GRIDMET fire‑danger (Burning Index / ERC / fuel moisture)
   - **landslide** → USGS landslide‑inventory susceptibility × rainfall trigger
   - **heat** → heat index + wet‑bulb temperature
   - **smoke** → downwind plume transport from FIRMS fires + wind
3. **Cascade graph** — probabilities propagate through trigger edges (noisy‑OR),
   producing a compound‑risk surface and the dominant **cascade chain** per cell.
4. **Exposure** — multiply by Census population → **expected people affected**.

## Forecast skill — measured, not assumed

Run `.\run.ps1 skill`. Honest, out‑of‑sample results (figures saved to `outputs/`):

| Component | Metric | Verdict |
|---|---|---|
| **Flood model** | ROC‑AUC **0.95**, Brier 0.08, isotonic‑calibrated | Strong & calibrated |
| **ENSO (ONI) forecast** | beats persistence **~30%** at +1/+2/+3 mo | Skillful |
| **ENSO → regional climate** | r≈0.4 (SE/S.Plains winter precip), RPSS≈0 | **Weak** US seasonal predictor — labeled as such |

We deliberately show where skill is **low** (the seasonal outlook is a weak guide)
rather than overstate it. The engine also backtests against the **Dec 2007
Chehalis** and **Nov 2021 Nooksack** floods (`run.ps1 validate`).

## Honest limitations

- **Research prototype.** Not validated for operational use; defer to official agencies.
- **Calibrated vs. index:** only **flood** (and the **earthquake** seismic prior) are calibrated probabilities. **Landslide / wildfire / heat / smoke are relative 0–1 hazard indices** — area‑scale danger, *not* calibrated odds of occurrence. Reports flag them with `*`.
- Maps are **~4–5 km cells**; the parcel report refines landslide with a local DEM slope, but other hazards remain area‑scale.
- The **seasonal outlook** has near‑zero out‑of‑sample probabilistic skill (ENSO is a weak US predictor) — it's a labeled weak guide.
- GRIDMET/Census are **US‑only**; live forecasting is point‑sampled (region size is bounded by API limits).

## Roadmap

- Calibrate/validate the remaining hazards as clean labels allow
- Full SST fields (OISST) + learned ENSO→regional teleconnections
- Sentinel‑1 InSAR / soil moisture; tsunami + volcano (lahar) cascades
- Gridded forecast (NDFD/GFS) for CONUS‑wide *forward* forecasts; hosted demo

## Reproducibility & provenance

- **Tests:** `pytest tests/` — offline unit tests for the cascade math, skill
  metrics, and predictor logic (run in CI on Python 3.10–3.12).
- **Pinned environment:** `requirements.txt` (loose) + `requirements.lock` (exact).
- **Data provenance:** every source, access method, and license is documented in
  [DATA_SOURCES.md](DATA_SOURCES.md). Validation data are static archives, so the
  `run.ps1 skill` results are reproducible.
- **Model cards:** per‑hazard intended use, method, skill, and limitations in
  [MODEL_CARDS.md](MODEL_CARDS.md) — including which outputs are *calibrated
  probabilities* vs *relative indices*.
- **Uncertainty:** weather‑driven hazards report a 10–90% interval from the
  31‑member GFS ensemble (forecast uncertainty), not just a point estimate.
- **Citation:** see [CITATION.cff](CITATION.cff).
